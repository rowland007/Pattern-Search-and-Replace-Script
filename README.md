# Pattern Search and Replace Script 
This repository is used for the fourth assignment for the class IT-140-Q3788 Introduction to Scripting 18EW3 at Southern New Hampshire University. The task for this project is to use regular expressions to discover and modify information from the provided test. The fourth artifact involves your use of regular expressions that search for specific patterns.

The project is broken into two sections:
* Determine the number of non alpha numeric characters in the `lorem_ipsum` string.
* Replace all instances of the words ‘_sit_’ and ‘_amet_’ separated by a dash `-` or a colon `:` with a space.


## Overview:
For your final project, you will be creating four small scripts. Collectively, the four scripts will demonstrate your ability to engage in the fundamental scripting and problem-solving approaches that are represented by the course outcomes.
Reminder: This the first draft. Even if your script is not functioning perfectly, submit your draft and get feedback so that you can improve on it for the final submission in Module Eight.

## Prompt:
The task for this project is to create a simple pattern 
search script. This script emphasizes the importance of regular expressions and their utility for searching, replacing, and managing large volumes of textual data.

The script should do the following three things:
* Define a regular expression pattern to search for non-alphanumeric values in a provided paragraph and output the number of matches to the console.
* Define a regular expression pattern to search for a two-word sequence separated by dashes and colons and output the number of matches to the console.
* Define a regular expression pattern to replace the dashes and colons identified in the previous search.

Specifically, the script should address the following 
**critical elements**:
* In Your Script (Annotated Text File) Refer to the directions in the module in Codio for how to export out and comment your completed script.
    * Identify an example of the use of a search using 
**literal characters** in the script using comments in your code.
    * Identify an example of the use of a search for 
**sequences and ranges** in the script using comments in your code.
    * Identify an example of a use of search for **special characters and wildcards** in the script using comments in your code.

## Reminder: 
The following **critical element** is not submitted with your draft, but you should be sure to consider the elements of your reflection that you will submit with your finalized script in Module Eight.

* Applying Your Experience - Making mistakes when you learn to write code is common. It is part of learning. What is important is developing the skill of learning how to understand your errors and then fix them (debugging). For this part of your final project, you will respond to the following:
    * Reflecting on your experience with this activity, explain the importance of knowing how and when to use and modify variables, and using branches. Support your response with examples from the activity of the types of errors and your method for fixing them.

## Rubric
### Guidelines for Submission: 
This is a draft of part of the final project. Complete the steps in Codio. Feedback will be provided by your instructor to incorporate in the final submission and the reflection document.

### Literal Characters
Identifies an example of the use of a search using literal characters in the script using comments in your code
### Sequences and Ranges
Identifies an example of the use of a search using sequences and ranges in the script using comments in your code 
### Special Characters and Wildcards
Identifies an example of the use of a search using special characters and wildcards in the script using comments in your code 
### Script Comments
Code comments explain and facilitate navigation of the code
